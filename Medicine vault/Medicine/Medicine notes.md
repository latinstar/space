### Is fibrosis associative or causative in AGA?

- This is best documented in [scleroderma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/scleroderma "Learn more about scleroderma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), a disease characterized by an overproduction of collagen (fibrosis) in [cutaneous tissues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/skin "Learn more about cutaneous tissues from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0125) (i.e., hands, arms, legs, lungs, and scalp skin) [26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0130).
- One case study found that scleroderma in dermal and epidermal scalp tissues leads to scalp hair loss [28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0140).

This suggests dermal sheath thickening and perifollicular fibrosis may be causative rather than associative to hair thinning, but by which mechanisms? The earliest signs of fibrosis in scleroderma [patients](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/patient "Learn more about patients from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") appear in the areas of severest vascular perturbation [29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0145). [Liver fibrosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-fibrosis "Learn more about Liver fibrosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") pathogenesis models demonstrate that excessive [extracellular matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/extracellular-matrix "Learn more about extracellular matrix from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") synthesis and deposition lead to [Hepatic] microvascular and nutritive degradation [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0150) – potentiating that decreased oxygen and nutrient supply are consequences of fibrosis progression.

One well-studied mediator of calcification and fibrosis is transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) [50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0250), [51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0255). TGF-β1 increases aortic calcification in sheep, potentially as a result of increased [alkaline phosphatase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/alkaline-phosphatase "Learn more about alkaline phosphatase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") activity [52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0260). TGF-β1 is also suspected to contribute to AGA [53](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0265). Studies conclude that TGF-β1 is an androgen-induced mediator of perifollicular fibrosis [54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0270) and may regulate the hair growth cycle as a negative growth factor [55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0275). Moreover, scalp DP cells produce higher levels of TGF-β2 than beard DP cells [56](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0280).

**Transforming growth factor beta 1** or **[TGF-β1]** is a polypeptide member of the [transforming growth factor beta superfamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta_superfamily "Transforming growth factor beta superfamily") of [cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine "Cytokine"). It is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of [cell growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth"), [cell proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_proliferation "Cell proliferation"), [cell differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_differentiation "Cell differentiation"), and [apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis "Apoptosis"). In humans, TGF-β1 is encoded by the _[TGFB1](https://www.genenames.org/tools/search/#!/genes?query=TGFB1)_ [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene").[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_1#cite_note-pmid10631145-5)[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_1#cite_note-pmid10843814-6)

### Explaining TGF-β1 activation in AGA through mechanotransduction

***If TGF-β1 is androgen-induced, why might TGF-β1 express more highly in AGA tissues versus secondary body and facial hair tissues? Evidence strongly implicates that this is due to mechanical tension.***

Mechanical tension has also been shown in periodontal tissues to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression [62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0310), a pathway activated during [prostaglandin D2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prostaglandin-d2 "Learn more about prostaglandin D2 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (PGD2) synthesis. Cell-generated mechanical tension also upregulates TGF-β from stiff extracellular matrix [63](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0315).

Interestingly, TGF-β1 is not only activated by androgenic activity [54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0270), but also by [reactive oxygen species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/reactive-oxygen-species "Learn more about reactive oxygen species from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (ROS) [58](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0290). ROS are found in AGA-prone tissues, and androgen-induced TGF-β1 in hair follicle DP cells is mediated by ROS [59](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717310411#b0295). Increased ROS activity may partly explain differences in TGF-β1 expression in body, facial, and AGA-prone follicle tissues.

## Conclusions
AGA is the result of chronic GA-transmitted scalp tension mediated by pubertal and post-pubertal skull bone growth and/or the overdevelopment and chronic contraction of muscles connected to the GA. This tension induces a pro-inflammatory cascade (increased [ROS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/reactive-oxygen-species "Learn more about ROS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), COX-2 signaling, IL-1, TNF-α, etc.) which induces TGF-β1 alongside increased androgen activity (5-αR2, DHT, and AR), which furthers TGF-β1 expression in already-inflamed AGA-prone tissues. The concomitant presence of DHT and TGF-β1 mediates perifollicular fibrosis, dermal sheath thickening, and calcification of the [capillary networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/capillary-network "Learn more about capillary networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") supporting AGA-prone hair follicles. These chronic, progressive conditions are the rate-limiting factors in AGA recovery. They restrict follicle growth space and decrease oxygen and nutrient supply to AGA-prone tissues – leading to tissue degradation, hair follicle miniaturization, and eventually pattern baldness.
