Most proteins [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding "Protein folding") into unique 3D structures. The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its [native conformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_conformation "Native conformation").[26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein#cite_note-Murray_2006-26): 36  Although many proteins can fold unassisted, simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids, others require the aid of molecular [chaperones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein) "Chaperone (protein)") to fold into their native states.[26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein#cite_note-Murray_2006-26): 37  Biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein's structure:[26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein#cite_note-Murray_2006-26): 30–34 

- _[Primary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_structure "Primary structure")_: the [amino acid sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence "Peptide sequence"). A protein is a [polyamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamide "Polyamide").
- _[Secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure "Secondary structure")_: regularly repeating local structures stabilized by [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond"). The most common examples are the [α-helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix "Alpha helix"), [β-sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet "Beta sheet") and [turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry) "Turn (biochemistry)"). Because secondary structures are local, many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule.
- _[Tertiary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure "Tertiary structure")_: the overall shape of a single protein molecule; the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another. Tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions, most commonly the formation of a [hydrophobic core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic_core "Hydrophobic core"), but also through [salt bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_bridge_(protein) "Salt bridge (protein)"), hydrogen bonds, [disulfide bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bond "Disulfide bond"), and even [posttranslational modifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification "Posttranslational modification"). The term "tertiary structure" is often used as synonymous with the term _fold_. The tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein.
- _[Quaternary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_structure "Quaternary structure")_: the structure formed by several protein molecules (polypeptide chains), usually called _[protein subunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit "Protein subunit")_ in this context, which function as a single [protein complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_complex "Protein complex").
- _[Quinary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quinary_structure "Protein quinary structure")_: the signatures of protein surface that organize the crowded cellular interior. Quinary structure is dependent on transient, yet essential, macromolecular interactions that occur inside living cells.
