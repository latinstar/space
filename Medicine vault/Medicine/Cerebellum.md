The cerebellum is a part of the brain that's located at the back of the head, near the brainstem. The word "cerebellum" comes from Latin and means "little brain". The cerebellum is involved in coordinating voluntary movements, including balance, coordination, and posture. It also plays a role in cognitive functions such as language and attention. The cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain, and then regulates control of movements.
